Missing primitive stuff you shouldn't need to re-implement yourself. I think
haddocks are pretty self-explanatory. Currently the package includes the
following functionality:

* scaling (bi-linear interpolation);
* cropping;
* flipping horizontally and vertically and 90° and 180° rotation (left and right).
* aligning two images side by side or one on top of the other.
